          Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror.
          Paranormal activity is on the rise and itâ€™s up to you and your team to
          use all the ghost-hunting equipment at your disposal in order to
          gather as much evidence as you can.
        </p>

      <section id="cursed">
        <h2 class="cursed-title">Cursed Objects</h2>
        <p>
          Cursed possessions are a group of seven powerful, supernatural items
          that are used to directly interface with the ghost. Using those items will help you identify the ghost type at the cost of your sanity.
          Activating or using a cursed possession will immediately cancel the setup phase.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="cursed__list">

          <li class="cursed__item">Music Box</li>
          <article>
           <img src="Music_box.webp" width="250" height="250" >
            <p class="cursed__music"> When picked up, the music box will open (this does not mean it has been activated). The music box can then be activated using the Primary Use key. Doing so will end the setup phase early if it is ongoing. The music box cannot be activated during a hunt, and can only be used once.
            Once activated, if the ghost is within 20 metres of the music box, it will sing along, broadcasting its current location while remaining invisible.
            If the music box is within 5 metres of the ghost, it will trigger a ghost event where the ghost manifests and begins to walk towards the box. The music box can be handheld or placed on the floor, the latter being the only safe way to discard the box without triggering a cursed hunt before the ghost event.
            In all cases, the box will close once it stops playing. </p>
           </article>

           <img src="ouija.avif" style="width:250px;height:250px;"> 
            <p class="cursed__text"> The Ouija Board can be activated by interacting with it if the player is not holding it, or toggling it directly while holding the board. The planchette will drop down onto the board, signifying that the board has been activated.
               There is currently a bug where an ongoing setup phase will only be canceled if a valid phrase has been recognized and not upon activation of the board.</p>

          <li class="cursed__item">Voodoo Doll</li>
          <article>
             <img src="voodoo.webp" width="250" height="250">
            <p class="cursed__text"> Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random. 
              This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the user's sanity by 5%. These forced interactions can include EMF Level 5 and Ultraviolet sources, but not the Ghost Writing Book.
             If the heart pin is pushed in, the user's sanity will drain by 10%, and the ghost will initiate a cursed hunt.
             If the user interacts with the voodoo doll while at 0% sanity, all remaining pins will be pushed in and a cursed hunt will also occur.</p>

             <img src="mirror.png" width="250" height="250">
            <p class="cursed__text"> When activated, the haunted mirror will show a view of the favorite room as a sweeping panorama from the center of the room, allowing players to locate the room by cross-reference.
               This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and equipment or players present in the room will be visible. 
               The only exception is the player's own model.</p>

          <li class="cursed__item">Summoning Circle</li>
          <article> 
           <img src="circle.png" width="250" height="250">
           <p class="cursed__text"> Once all five candles are lit, the ghost is summoned and fully materialized, except a Shade, which has a chance of appearing as a transparent shadow. The summoned ghost stays motionless for 5 seconds, unable to kill players. This stationary period is considered a ghost event. 
            However, the front door will lock immediately after lighting the last candle. After this event, the lights in the summoning circle's room will turn off and the ghost will immediately initiate a cursed hunt on the spot, without an additional 1-second grace period. 
            Once the summoning circle is activated, it cannot be used again.</p>

           <img src="paw.png" width="250" height="250">
           <p class="cursed__text"> The Monkey Paw can only be used within the investigation area, and players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to make wishes.
            If using voice chat, the Monkey Paw will grant any recognized wish made by the player.
            If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon pressing the Primary Use button. Players can then click to select one of 3 categories, then select a category-specific wish, or exit the UI by pressing the Primary Use button again.
            Every wish will come with a negative side effect, with the severity depending on the wish. </p>
