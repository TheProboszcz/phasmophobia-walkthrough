        <b>Cursed Items</b>
        <p>
          Cursed possessions are a group of seven powerful, supernatural items
          that are used to directly interface with the ghost. They can make the
          ghost appear or provide information, generally at the cost of sanity.
          These items are the Music Box, Ouija Board, Voodoo Doll, Haunted
          Mirror, Summoning Circle, Monkey Paw, and Tarot Cards. Activating or
          using a cursed possession will immediately cancel the setup phase.
